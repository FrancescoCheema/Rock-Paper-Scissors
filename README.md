# Rock-Paper-Scissors
a rock paper scissors game where I've applied my knowledge with:
CSS Flexbox,
CSS Animation,
Dom Manipulation,
Event Listeners,
Query Selectors,
Creating a user-friendly ui.
I've also had the opportunity to learn how to create a new branch with Git and merge my changes from the new project to the previous one without GUI.
